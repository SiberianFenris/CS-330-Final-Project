**1. How do I approach designing software?**

When I'm going to design a software the first thing that I do is look over the requirements and understand what is expected of the product and of myself. After that I will break each item off to a separate task and prioritize them. I will also get an idea of what types of tests I should be running as I plan my tasks. Once I do that, I will begin writing chunks of code. My work on this project really helped me learn to fully read all documentation provided. There were a few times at the start that I overlooked small things and fortunately caught them in time. This was a great opportunity to improve.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**

When it comes to actually developing a program I will write a little at a time and test off. I will also often reference back to requirements to ensure that I'm not only meeting them but can stay on top of any changes. This also helps me with ensuring that the tests that I'm writing are going to be useful. While I wouldn't say I really implemented any new strategies, at least not that I'm aware of, I feel that this course helped me really improve my research skills.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

As mentioned above, this course was a huge help in really honing my research skills. It took a lot of searching and a ton of reading to get anywhere with my project. OpenGL was something completely new to me so I was often very lost. I learned several tricks for really nailing down the best Google searches for when you need an answer. Although you could potentially find your needed results searching the old fashioned way, knowing how to narrow it down can save you a lot of time when looking for issues that may be incredibly similar but different enough to be useless to you.
